How to access to the Atlas Database :

    -Create a '.env' file in the './Backend' folder.
    
    -Copy and paste the following lines in the '.env' file :

ATLAS_URI='PASTE_YOUR_URI_HERE'

    -Replace the 'PASTE_YOUR_URI_HERE' by the connection URI of the Atlas Database (it might be given in another secret file, and never appear in the Github page of the project).

    -Add your '.env' file to your '.gitignore' file, in order to protect the privacy of the URI.
